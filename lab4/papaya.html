        Papayas, originally from Central America, are tropical fruits known for their sweet, orange flesh and rich nutritional benefits. 
        They are packed with vitamin C, vitamin A, and antioxidants like lycopene, which support immune health and skin vitality. Papayas 
        contain papain, an enzyme that aids digestion and helps break down proteins, making them beneficial for gut health.

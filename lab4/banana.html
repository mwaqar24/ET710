        Bananas originated in Southeast Asia, particularly in Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines, before
         spreading to other parts of the world. They are rich in essential nutrients like potassium, vitamins 
         B6 and C, and fiber, making them a highly nutritious fruit. Bananas provide a quick energy boost due to
          their natural sugars and support digestion by preventing constipation. Their high potassium content 
          helps regulate blood pressure and promotes heart health, while the presence of tryptophan aids in
           serotonin production, improving mood and reducing stress.
